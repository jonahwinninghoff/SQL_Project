# SQL Capstone Project

All works have done using Databricks and R and please consider this as a portfolio of my coding work. This work is related to SQL Data Science Specialization developed by UC Davis and hosted by Coursera. The database developed by the Lobbyists4America institution who is interested in data-driven approaches contains two different datasets, which are Twitter and Users. Both can be found in **Datasets** file. One of these datasets requires using several natural language processing (*NLP*) techinques. There are two different analyses that are in use. The first one is Sentiment Analysis and the second one Climate Denial Detection System. More details can be seen in Presentation.Rmd, which is in **Scripts** file. 

- All Databricks and R doing scripts can be found in **Scripts** file.
- All tidy and raw datasets can be found in **Datasets** file.

Please take your time to view this coding works. The Presentation.Rmd is self-explanatory. If you do not want to execute the Presentation.Rmd code to understand my work, please look up at this [website](https://rpubs.com/jonahwinninghoff/SQL_Final_Project).
